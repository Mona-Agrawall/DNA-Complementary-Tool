ðŸ§¬ DNA Complementary Tool
Welcome to the DNA Complementary Tool, a simple yet powerful front-end web application designed to help users generate complementary DNA strands and store bio-data.

# Project Overview
The DNA Complementary Tool allows users to input DNA sequences, generate their complementary strands using base-pairing rules, and store the information for future use. It also provides functionality to clear saved data and start fresh every time the page is reopened.

# Features
DNA Input & Complementary Strand Generation: Enter a DNA strand, and the tool will instantly generate the complementary strand.
Persistent Data Storage: User data is stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage, ensuring it remains available even after refreshing the page.
Clear Data Button: Easily clear stored data with the click of a button.
Save Button: Save your input data for later use.
Responsive UI: A clean, user-friendly interface with mobile and desktop responsiveness.
# Target Audience
The DNA Complementary Tool is ideal for students, bioinformatics enthusiasts, and anyone curious about DNA structure and base-pairing mechanics.

# Technology Stack
This project is a frontend-only web application built using:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Pyodide (Python in the browser for running bio-related scripts)

# How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DNA-Complementary-Tool.git
Navigate to the project folder and open index.html in your browser.

Input a DNA sequence and click "Save". The complementary strand will be displayed.

Use the "Clear Data" button to reset stored information, or reload the page for a fresh start.

# Future Enhancements
Implementing RNA transcription functionality.
Adding export features to download data as a file.
Enhancing data visualization with graphical outputs.
